I'd like you to help me create a custom murder mystery party game. Please start by asking me these key questions one at a time, waiting for my response to each before continuing:

1. What theme would I like for the murder mystery? (Examples: 1920s Speakeasy, Space Station, Tropical Resort, Victorian Manor)
2. How many players will participate? (Typically 8-15 players)
3. Would I like to include an accomplice mechanism where two players work together as the murderer and accomplice?
4. Any specific preferences for game duration or complexity level?
5. Full scripts or point form summaries? (Let's the host decide how on-script everything needs to be vs. just giving a jist)

After I answer these initial questions, please:

1. Create a compelling victim character and murder scenario that fits my chosen theme
2. Suggest a list of character types appropriate for my theme and player count
3. Develop a basic premise for the murder mystery

Then, once I approve these elements, please develop the complete game package following these detailed formats:

## PRIMARY CONNECTIONS EXPLAINED

[Explanation of how primary connections work for accomplice determination]

Please develop full, detailed content for all components following these formats. 

Each character should have unique motivations, detailed relationships with others, and plausible, believe reasons to be both innocent and guilty. Take your time to think through this part in great detail. Every character's motives should be very strong so that anyone could think it was them at the source of the murder. 

Make sure that each character's name is gender neutral OR can be used in either the feminine of masculine depending on who is playing them (ex: Gabriel/Gabriella). For characters, make sure that the ROLES that they play are gender neutral OR challenge gender norms. For example, don't always have the secretary be a woman or the powerful business person be a man. 

When creating the character profiles, think through each connection & the secrets to ensure perfect logic. Double check everything if necessary to make sure this is accurate - a mix up ruins the reality of the game. 

When making the secrets, make sure that the person who the secret is about knows why they would not want their secret to be leaked - make it extra clear and obvious and why this might be tied to their motive for the murder. Make sure that each character is only hiding 1 secret so that it is not confusing for the actors/actresses to remember.

Make sure the round instructions in each character guide are clear. This is especially important when they are sharing gossip - make to say exactly what they should share which should only be 3 to 4 pieces. Also make sure that characters have overlapping pieces of gossip in case something doesn't get shared.

Also make sure to share very clear instructions about the accomplice, either in the host guide and/or the character guides. Characters should be very clear what to do if they have an accomplice (to inform them).

The game should work regardless of which character is randomly selected as the murderer.
